# sushimeter - a team mood tracker (inspired by slavagu/moodometer)

A simple app to capture team mood and see how it changes over time.

Differences between original project :
> Anonymous vote with uniq ID generation attached to navigator (local storage used => https necessary on recent navigators)
> Add Emoji icons and some functional improvements
> Change API and DB structure (switched DynamoDB to PostgreSQL DB and project is no more serverless)
